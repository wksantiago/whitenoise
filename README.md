## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Flutter SDK** (3.24.x or later) - [Install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- **Rust** (latest stable) - [Install Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Just** (command runner) - `cargo install just`
- **flutter_rust_bridge_codegen** - `cargo install flutter_rust_bridge_codegen`
- **Local nostr relays and blossom server** (Optional): for local testing with nostr relays and blossom server:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/parres-hq/whitenoise
   cd whitenoise
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/parres-hq/whitenoise_flutter.git
   cd whitenoise_flutter
   ```

2. **Setup the project**

   ```bash
   just setup
   ```

   This command will:
   - Check your development environment
   - Clean any existing builds
   - Install dependencies
   - Generate bridge code
   - Build the Rust library

3. **Run the app**

```bash

   flutter run
   ```

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Local whitenoise-rs Development

This project uses a local copy of the `whitenoise-rs` backend library for development. Changes to the whitenoise-rs repository will automatically reflect when you rebuild.

**Setup:**

The project is configured to use the local whitenoise-rs repository at:
`/home/william/Projects/Repo/whitenoise-rs`

This is configured in `rust/Cargo.toml`:
```toml
whitenoise = { version = "0.1.0", path = "/home/william/Projects/Repo/whitenoise-rs", features = ["insecure-local-signer"] }
```

**Workflow for making changes to whitenoise-rs:**

1. Make your changes in the `whitenoise-rs` repository
2. Return to this project (whitenoise)
3. Rebuild the Rust code:
   ```bash
   just regenerate  # Regenerate bridge code if API changed
   just build-rust-debug  # Build the Rust library
   ```
4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

**Note:** If you modify the public API in whitenoise-rs, you may need to update the wrapper code in `rust/src/api/` to match the new API.

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Setup project for new developers
just setup

# Run the app in debug mode
flutter run

# Run pre-commit checks (formatting, linting, analysis, tests)
just precommit


# List available devices
flutter devices
```

### Code Generation & Dependencies

```bash
# Regenerate flutter_rust_bridge code
just regenerate

# Install dependencies
just deps              # Install both Flutter and Rust deps
just deps-flutter      # Flutter dependencies only
just deps-rust         # Rust dependencies only

```

### Building

```bash
# Build for development
just build-rust-debug  # Rust library (debug)
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code
just format            # Format both Rust and Dart
just format-rust       # Format Rust only
just format-dart       # Format Dart only

# Lint and analyze
just lint              # Lint both Rust and Dart
just lint-rust         # Rust clippy
just analyze           # Flutter analyzer

# Fix common issues automatically
just fix
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run tests
just test-rust         # Rust unit tests
just test-flutter      # Flutter unit tests (when test/ exists)
```

### Coverage

You need to install lcov to generate report
```bash
# Mac OS
brew install lcov

# Linux
apt-get install lcov

# Windows
choco install lcov
```

```bash
# Run tests with coverage and check diff coverage for changed files
just check-flutter-coverage

# Or run tests with coverage output manually
flutter test --coverage
# Generate coverage html report
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html 
# Open coverage/html/index.html in your browser
```

### Cleaning

```bash
# Clean builds
just clean-flutter     # Flutter build cache
just clean-rust        # Rust build cache
just clean-bridge      # Generated bridge files
just clean-all         # Everything
```

### Utilities

```bash
# Project information
just info              # Show versions and dependency info
just doctor            # Check development environment

# Documentation
just docs-rust         # Generate and open Rust docs
```

## 🔄 CI/CD

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration:

- **Triggers**: Pushes and PRs to `main` and `develop` branches
- **Checks**:
  - Rust formatting (`cargo fmt --check`)
  - Dart formatting (`dart format --set-exit-if-changed`)
  - Rust linting (`cargo clippy`)
  - Flutter analysis (`flutter analyze`)
  - Rust tests (`cargo test`)

### Running CI Checks Locally

Before pushing code, run the same checks that CI will run:

```bash
just precommit
```

This ensures your code will pass CI checks.

## 📋 Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Rust**: Follow standard Rust conventions, use `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`
- **Dart**: Follow Flutter/Dart conventions, use `dart format` and `flutter analyze`
- **Zero warnings policy**: All code must pass linting without warnings

### Commit Workflow

1. Make your changes
2. Run `just precommit` to ensure code quality
3. Commit and push
4. CI will automatically run the same checks

### Adding Dependencies

- **Rust deps**: Add to `rust/Cargo.toml`, then run `just deps-rust`
- **Flutter deps**: Add to `pubspec.yaml`, then run `just deps-flutter`
- **Bridge regeneration**: Run `just regenerate` after adding Rust public functions

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Bridge generation fails**

   ```bash
   just clean-bridge
   just regenerate
   ```

2. **Build errors after dependency changes**

   ```bash
   just clean-all
   just deps
   just regenerate
   ```

3. **Platform-specific build issues**

   ```bash
   just doctor  # Check your development environment
   ```

**Contribution guidelines**

We want to keep our codebase clean, consistent, and easy to contribute to. Here are some guidelines to follow:

- ✅ Unit tests: Add unit tests for all new providers.
- ♻️ Widget design: Try to keep widgets small and simple. Extract complex logic to notifiers.
- 🏷️ Naming: Shared custom widgets should use the `Wn` prefix for consistency.
